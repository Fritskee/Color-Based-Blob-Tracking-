# Color-Based-Blob-Tracking-
Tracking a "blob" Based on a specific color, Implemented in OpenFrameworks with the OpenCV Library


## # Welcome to the Color-Based-Blob-Tracking- wiki!

This code can be used to create an interactive application that uses color-based blob tracking. The application can be tested by going through the following steps: 

Step 1: Wear a colored finger cap on the index finger. (In my case I wore a bright green cap)

Step 2: Adjust the sliding bars Such that only the color of the cap occurs on the webcam image.

Step 3: Press key ‘s’ to start/stop the drawing mode. Under the drawing mode, you can move your finger in front of webcam, and draw a line sketch with the color of the finger cap on top of the webcam image.

Press 's' again to stop the drawing mode. Another press on ‘s’ starts drawing mode again, a new line sketch will be created.
